# Server side rendered component

## What we will cover

* How can we scale a web application without a Javascript framework?
* What are the benefits to not using a framework?
* What are the downsides to not using a framework?

## Notes

I argue that most of the benefits from a Javascript framework comes
from the structure it brings which allows a team of developers to 
produce consistent results.

The benefit of not using a framework is that your application will
stand the test of time and be lighter.

The downside is that the risk of code rot is greater and the complexity
of solving certain problems goes up by a lot, for example routing.

The challenges you face when you create a scalable frontend project is:

* Modularity
* State
* Simplicity

So what is the big problem with this solution?
In order for this to work long term you need really good frontend developers
who know how to build big Javascript projects and that is rare.
Most of the time mainstream frameworks are easier to maintain over time
since they are made to be a decent solution to the biggest audience.

This demo project is what I would do if I knew I had really great engineers
who can handle the complexity.
